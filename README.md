# Reproductive Rights Information

A web app to keep you up-to-date with the current abortion laws going into effect across the nation.

## Project Description 

Users can use this web app to stay in the loop with national and state-specific abortion laws currently going into effect in the aftermath of Roe v. Wade being overturned. There is a Twitter feed section that displays information from multiple accounts for the most recent news regarding the current state of reproductive rights. There is also an integrated search bar from Google to look up specific information that may not be currently displayed on the screen. 

## Technologies/API's Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Google Fonts, Font Awesome, Twitter Publish, Programmable Search Engine from Google, https://newscatcherapi.com, https://legiscan.com/legiscan

## Roadmap

In the future, we want to implement the Google Maps API to display which states have decided to keep abortion legal or have decided to ban it with a color-coded chart. We would also like to display the locations of available abortion clinics on the map. Along with the map feature, we would like to add a blog section where users can login with a username and password to create and comment on blog posts.
